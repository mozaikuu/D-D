### first iteration

make player class
make children classes from player class
make multiclass from chlidren classes
items, weapons, spells, hp and inventory are all objects
mobs have their own classes as well
save and load the players

### second iteration

make hardcoded players with manual changes for deadline maybe expand later
changed inventory to "bag" and made everythin in it a list for easier use
